# splitcost

A home-developed hobby project to play around and get some expertise in Spring.

It was raised in a chaos, but order will eventually take over. List of things that should happen:

A) On the BackEnd:
- JavaDocs
- Unit tests
- Introduce modular design
- Abstract factory for entity creation
- Once moved to REST API, Controllers, DTO-s can be refactored, business logic which is now in views can be moved to services

B) On the FrontEnd:
- Lose thymeleaf, move to REST API with first Vanilla JS then probably Angular
